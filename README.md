# sample-assessment-workflow
Example of using GitHub actions / workflows for a comprehensive assessment of a software assignment

## Intro

GitHub workflows can be used to run scripts to assess a software assignment.

Here we show a small software assignment and how we can automate:

* Running unit tests
* Running integration tests
* Run performance tests
* Produce graphical output
* Run software metrics

To act as a student fork the repo, develop your solution to the assignment, and get rapid feedback!
